# bitsgap_tt

A technical task (TT) implementation for Bitsgap

# A little bit of explanation
The code was written in DDD architecture with MobX state management. The architecture is implemented solely because it was required in the description of TT. I could have used more packages such as freezed for code generation, or retrofit for API request, which help to clean up the code, it was also said not to overengineer, therefore I tried to keep it simple, and yet to showcase my abilities. I've attached the screenshots and screen recording for your convinience and to show it works if in any case there are problems running the code. I'm used to using Bloc as state management, so I had to make a research on MobX, therefore it might have not been implemented the best way, as I have no commercial experience with it. I decided not to make a separate branch with Bloc, because it wouldn't make much difference, I'd have to only replace the MainObservable with Bloc implementation, and Observer with BlocBuilder in MainScreen. It makes sense as both Bloc and MobX are state management tools, and I got again aproved of it after using MobX.

Thanks,
